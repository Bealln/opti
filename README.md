DE4 Opti Coursework 2018/19: Code Submission
============

Please find the code, report and tutorials for our (Bea Lopez-Neira, Paolo RÃ¼egg) team's optimisation project.

The code runs in Python 3.X and has the following dependencies:

* scipy
* matplotlib
* numpy
* jupyter (for tutorial only)

You can install all of these with the following command: pip3 install numpy scipy matplotlib

Contents
----------

This repository contains the report as well as all the code to obtain the results obtained. The directory structure relevant for marking is:

system_level      Contai  ns the system-level optimisation
subsystem_cost    Contains Bea Lopez-Neira's individual contribution
subsystem_light   Contains Paolo's individual contribution

In order to ease execution of the code to reproduce results, an optimisation is presented in the form of a jupyter notebook for both subsystems and for the system-level analysis. There are a total of three tutorials, one in each of the above folders.
