DE4 Opti Coursework: Code Submission (Bea Lopez-Neira, Paolo RÃ¼egg)
============

Please find the code, report and tutorials for our team's optimisation project in this repository.

The code runs in Python 3.X and has the following dependencies:

* scipy
* matplotlib
* numpy
* jupyter (for tutorials only)

Please note that you might have to install anaconda if you are not working from a UNIX-based system. You can install all of these with the following command: pip3 install numpy scipy matplotlib jupyter

Contents
----------

This repository contains the report as well as all the code to obtain the results obtained. The directory structure relevant for marking is:

[system_level](https://github.com/pa17/opti/tree/master/system_level)     Contains the system-level optimisation

[subsystem_cost](https://github.com/pa17/opti/tree/master/subsystem_cost)    Contains Bea Lopez-Neira's individual contribution

[subsystem_light](https://github.com/pa17/opti/tree/master/subsystem_light)   Contains Paolo's individual contribution

In order to ease execution of the code to reproduce results, an optimisation is presented in the form of a jupyter notebook for both subsystems and for the system-level analysis. There are a total of three tutorials, one in each of the above folders.
